# 🚧 SafeRoad AI – Intelligent Road Safety Intervention System

**SafeRoad AI** is an intelligent system that analyzes road safety reports and automatically recommends relevant **IRC-based safety interventions**.  
It leverages **AI (Gemini)** to generate meaningful explanations that help **engineers and authorities** make data-driven decisions for safer roads.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Manual analysis of road safety reports is time-consuming and prone to human oversight.  
There is a lack of automated tools to extract key issues and map them to standard **IRC safety interventions** efficiently.

---

## 💡 Solution
SafeRoad AI uses **AI-powered text understanding** to:
- Extract key road issues from uploaded **PDF reports** or manual text.
- Match them with predefined **IRC interventions**.
- Generate a professional **AI summary** explaining the rationale behind each recommendation.
